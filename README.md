# C2ME ( client side )

For now, I won't write any explanations until I test the solution.<br>
but it's the same as [J2ME](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Platform,_Micro_Edition), except you write in C/C++

is actually a Software ARM Core (Emulator) and can execute C/C++ ( Rust too )<br>
code from any hardware architecture ( MCU such as ESP32, PIC32, STM32, RISC-V, PC ... etc )
